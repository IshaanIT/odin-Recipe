    <h1>Rocky Mountain Oysters</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bull or pig testicles</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    Instructions:
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and prepare the testicles: Start by washing the testicles under cold running water and removing the outer skin. Then, slice the testicles into thin, round slices about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Soak the testicles in milk: Place the sliced testicles in a bowl and pour enough milk over them to cover them completely. Let them soak for at least 1 hour. This helps to remove any unwanted flavors and to tenderize the meat.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Coat the testicles in the flour mixture: Remove the testicles from the milk and dredge them in the flour mixture, making sure to coat them thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Fry the testicles: Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 375F. Carefully add the testicles to the hot oil and fry them until they are golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and serve: Remove the fried testicles from the oil and drain them on a paper towel. Serve them hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ranch dressing or hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    Note: Rocky Mountain Oysters can also be grilled, baked, or sauted instead of deep-fried.
