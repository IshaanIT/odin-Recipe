    <ul>
        <li>4-6 tarantulas</li>
        <li>1 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>Bamboo skewers (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the fangs, venom glands, and hairs from the tarantulas. If you are not sure how to do this, it's best to purchase cleaned tarantulas from a reputable seller.</li>
        <li>Mix the salt, sugar, and garlic powder in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a pan until it reaches 375F (190C).</li>
        <li>Roll the tarantulas in the spice mixture, making sure they are fully coated.</li>
        <li>If using skewers, gently pierce the tarantulas through the abdomen and thorax, leaving the legs and head free.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the tarantulas in the hot oil and fry them for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the tarantulas from the oil and place them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
      
      Note: Some people prefer to remove the abdomen and legs before frying the tarantulas, 
      but this is a matter of personal preference. While fried tarantulas may not be for everyone, 
      they are considered a delicacy in certain parts of the world. 
      If you decide to give this recipe a try,
      make sure to purchase your tarantulas from a reputable source and follow food safety guidelines when preparing and cooking them.
